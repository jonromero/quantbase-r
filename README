This is an image that has the most common used libraries for quantitative portfolio analysis (in R) that we use at AgentRisk. 
The reason why I wanted to have an image instead of just building on top of rocker/r-base, is because most of the libraries that we are using take a lot of time to be compiled. 

The libraries that are compiled and included are:

PortfolioAnalytics, quantmod, PerformanceAnalytics, zoo, ROI, ROI.plugin.quadprog, ROI.plugin.glpk, magrittr, plumber, jsonlite, xts, httr, dplyr

So there you have it, a docker image that has all the tools you need out of the box.
